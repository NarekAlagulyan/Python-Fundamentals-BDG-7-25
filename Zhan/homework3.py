#The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages, where the entire program is translated into machine code before execution, Python is an interpreted language. This means the interpreter processes and executes the code line by line or in small blocks.

# In Python, "source code" refers to the set of human-readable instructions written by a programmer using the Python programming language. These instructions, typically saved in plain text files with a .py extension, define the logic and behavior of a Python program.

#Python bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of your Python source code. When you run a Python script, the CPython interpreter first compiles the human-readable source code (.py file) into this intermediate bytecode.

#When you run a Python program, the source code is first compiled into a low-level, platform-independent representation called bytecode. The PVM then interprets and executes this bytecode.
