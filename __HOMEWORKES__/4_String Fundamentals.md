# String Fundamentals Homework

### Part 1

1.  How can you type a string literal with single and double quotes inside it?
2.  How can you type a multiline string?
3.  Name at least three string methods.
4.  Are strings mutable or immutable? What does this mean for your code?
5.  What is the difference between the string find and index methods?
6.  How can you check if a string contains only alphabetic characters?
7.  How do you remove whitespace from the ends of a string?
8.  How would you split a string into a list of words?

### Part 2

Let's test your string smarts with some more tricky questions!

1.  What is the output of the following code?
    `print('H' + 'a' * 5)`
2.  How would you get the last character of a string `s` without using `len()`?
3.  If `s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'`, what would `s.find('g')` return?
4.  How would you convert the string `'123'` into an integer?
5.  True or False: `'apple'.upper() == 'Apple'.upper()`
6.  What method would you use to replace all occurrences of 'i' with 'o' in a string?
7.  How can you create a raw string? Why would you need one?
8.  What is the result of `'Python'[1:4]`?
9.  **New!** What does the `strip()` method do? Can you give an example?
10. **New!** How can you check if a string `s` starts with the word "Hello"?
11. **New!** What is the output of `'python'.islower()`?
12. **New!** How would you join a list of strings `['Hello', 'world']` into a single string with a space in between?

### Part 3: Easy String Tasks

More practice to build your confidence.

1.  **Greeting Card:** Create a variable `name` and assign your name to it. Then create another variable `greeting` and assign a nice message to it. Finally, print the greeting and your name together.
2.  **String Repeater:** Ask the user for their favorite word and a number. Then, print their favorite word that many times.
3.  **Slicing Fun:** Create a string that is at least 10 characters long. Then print:
    * The first three characters.
    * The last three characters.
    * The string backward.
4.  **Case Converter:** Create a string with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Print the string in all uppercase and then in all lowercase.
5.  **Character Counter:** Ask the user for a sentence and a letter. Count how many times that letter appears in the sentence.
6.  **New!** **The Titleizer:** Take a sentence from the user (e.g., "the quick brown fox") and print it in title case ("The Quick Brown Fox").
7.  **New!** **Whitespace Warrior:** Create a string with extra spaces at the beginning and end (e.g., `"   some text   "`). Print the string with the extra spaces removed.
8.  **New!** **The Replacer:** Create a sentence like "I like cats." Ask the user for a word to replace "cats" with, and print the new sentence.

### Part 4: Brain-Teaser String Challenges (More Puzzles!)

1.  **Palindrome Checker:** A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam", "racecar"). Write a script that checks if a given word is a palindrome. You are not allowed to use any loops. (Hint: Slicing is your friend!)
2.  **The Formatter:** Create a Mad Libs-style script. Create a story with placeholders like `[adjective]`, `[noun]`, `[verb]`. Ask the user for words to fill in these placeholders and then print the final story using string formatting.
3.  **The Great Swap:** Given a string, create a new string where the first and last characters are swapped. For example, 'python' becomes 'nythop'.
4.  **New!** **The Pig Latin Translator:** Write a script that translates a single word into Pig Latin. The rule is simple: move the first letter to the end of the word and add "ay". For example, "python" becomes "ythonpay".
5.  **New!** **The Vowel Remover:** Ask the user for a sentence and create a new sentence with all the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) removed. (Hint: you can use the `replace()` method multiple times).
