1: Consider the following three statements. Do they change the value printed for A?
A = "spam"
B = A
B = "shrubbery"

2: Consider these three statements. Do they change the printed value of A?
A = ["spam"]
B = A
B[0] = "shrubbery"

3: How about theseâ€”is A changed now?
A = ["spam"]
B = A[:]
B[0] = "shrubbery"

4: Explain in details the difference between is and ==

5: What does id function do and what does it return.

6: What is Object Interning

7: What is Garbage Collector(GC) and how does it work(simple explanation) in CPython

8: Aliasing with mutable and immutable types
Show examples of what happens when two variables point to the same list, dictionary, string, integer, etc., and one of them changes.
Why does the change sometimes affect both variables, and sometimes not?

9: Draw a memory diagram
For each scenario(homework scenarios and your own random scenarios), draw boxes showing
Objects in memory
Variable names pointing to them
How these connections change after each statement
